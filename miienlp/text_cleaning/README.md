# Text Cleaning


## Description

Text cleaning is an important step beforing feeding texts into different NLP models. This code will perform various cleaning of text for multiple areas of research including (but not limited to): lexicon counts, contextual word vectors, sentiment analysis, and bundled constructs. The default setting will:
- remove excess new line characters and white spaces; 
- remove (non-ASCII) characters. 

One can also customize the settings to remove puncuation, digits, or convert all letters to lower case, depending on the needs and next steps. We provide some examples input files (for specific cleaning needs) to feed into different pipelines.
