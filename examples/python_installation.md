## Getting Started with Python!

If you are completely new to Python, here are some resources to get you started:

1. Download python 
   - We recommend the users to download and install [Anaconda Python distribution](http://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution). 
   
2. Create a new environment 
   - After installing Anaconda, we will create a new python environment inside Anaconda. Please follow the instructions [here](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-with-commands) to create a Python 3.7.x environment. 
   - Then open your terminal, and type :
   
    ```
    conda info --envs 
    ```
    
    to find the new environment you just create. You will get a list of envrionment names and their locations. Copy the location of that environment and type 
    
    ```
    conda activate /Users/xxx/location/of/your/environment
    ```
 
You are all set! 

We will be running all the codes in this environment.
